Description of the Project: 
We intend to predict the sale price of property in Ames, Iowa State in United States based on price of the land, age of the house, number of bed-rooms, number of bathrooms, number of garages, neighbourhood, amenities, locality,etc. We intend to address this  with different approaches-- linear regression model with various feature transformations, Neural Network and Random Forest models, and also work on reducing the impact of multicollinearity. We have taken the data from the open data source "kaggle data sets". The data has 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa
